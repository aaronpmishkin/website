# About 
@@

I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. I previously completed my master's in computer science at the University of British Columbia, where I was advised by [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/). My research interests are in optimization for machine learning.

## 2020

* **September 10**: I have relocated to Stanford University to begin my PhD! 
* **June 29 - July 10**: I had a lot of fun attending the virtual MLSS this year — many thanks to the organizers for their hard work! My virtual poster is public on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IchhE4JXLE4).
* **June 15**: New preprint is on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06821)! I had great fun helping out with the experiments for this work on implicit regularization and preconditioners in generalized linear models.
* **April 29**: I will attend the (virtual) [MLSS 2020](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/index.html) from 28 June to 10 July this summer.

## 2019

* **September 25**: I'm organizing an overview of the interplay between optimization and generalization for [UBC MLRG](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/lci/mlrg/) this semester! It includes "sharp" local minima, implicit regularization, and interpolation.
* **September 4**: I ranked in the top 50% of reviewers for NeurIPS 2019! This was my first time reviewing; I reviewed eight papers, including two emergency reviews.
* **September 4**: Our work on the [stochastic Armijo line-search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09997) has been accepted for a poster at NeurIPS 2019!
* **May 1 - August 31**: I'm interning with [Cédric Archambeau](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.archambeau/) and [Matthias Seeger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V-lc8A8AAAAJ&hl=en) at Amazon Research in Berlin.

## 2018

* **September 4**: Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04504) on low-rank Gaussian variational inference for Bayesian neural networks was accepted at NeurIPS 2018! 
* **June 25 - 29**: I was a teaching assistant for the approximate Bayesian inference tutorial at the [2018 Data Science Summer School at École Polytechnique](http://www.ds3-datascience-polytechnique.fr/). The tutorial resources are [here](https://emtiyaz.github.io/teaching/ds3_2018/ds3.html).
* **January 21 - June 30**: I joined [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) as an intern at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP).
